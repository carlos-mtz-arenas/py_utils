This is just a collection of scripts I usually use on my daily basis to automate some tasks of on my development, like:

* Testing services endpoints
* Resizing images
* More Stuff

* [Send XML files from a directory (actual test case was for sending idocs on a SAP integration) to an endpoint](send_idocs.py)
* [Resizes images from a directory to an squared image and moves the resized images to a new directory to protect the original ones](resize_images.py) - This one may not be parametrized but works.. I will probably refactor it later!
* [How to resize an uploaded image on python to save, useful on cases of: saving thumbnails](django_resize_image_endpoint.py)
